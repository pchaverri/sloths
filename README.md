**_Bradypus_ and _Choloepus_ fecal microbial communities supplementary material.**

Some of the tables are within Excel tabs.

**Table S1**. These data come from running the Kaiju nr_euk database with assembled metagenomes.

**Table S2**. Pivot and interactive table with taxonomy and abundance, from metagenomic sequencing, both sloth species, and Kaiju nr_euk database

**Table S3**. These data come from running the Kaiju fungi database with assembled metagenomes.

**Table S4**. Results of Kraken database search for <i>Bradypus</i>.

**Table S5**. Results of Kraken database search for <i>Choloepus</i>.

**Table S6**. These data come from running Kaiju nr_euk database with an assembled metatranscriptome of a <i>Choloepus hoffmanni</i> RNA pool.

**Table S7**. Pivot and interactive table with taxonomy and abundance, from metatranscriptomic sequencing, <i>Choloepus</i> pool, and Kaiju nr_euk database (from Table S6).

**Table S8**. Abundance (#reads) and taxonomy of ITS1 fungi metabarcoding.

**Table S9**. Abundance (#reads) and taxonomy of ITS2 fungi metabarcoding.

**Table S10**. Raw eggNOG-mapper results for <i>Bradypus variegatus</i>, all samples combined, from metagenomic data.

**Table S11**. Raw eggNOG-mapper results for <i>Choloepus hoffmanni</i>, all samples combined, from metagenomic data. Due to the large size of this file, the table has been divided into 9 parts. Parts 1-8 include all classified COGs. Part 9 consists of unclassified COGs.

**Table S12**. Summary of eggNOG-mapper functional annotation for metagenomic data for <i>Choloepus</i> and <i>Bradypus</i>. Only fungi and bacteria are included (from Tables S10 and S11).

**Table S13**. Raw results from eggNOG mapper classification from <i>Choloepus</i> RNA pools.

**Table S14**. Pivot and interactive tables with data from eggNOG mapper classification from <i>Choloepus</i> RNA pools (Table S13).

In addition, **interactive Krona figures in HTML format for Figure 3** are included (Krona_Bradypus.html) and (Krona_Choloepus.html). These HTML files include all taxa (Prokaryota, Eukaryota and Viruses).
